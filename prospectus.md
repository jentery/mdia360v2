# Research Prospectus (DRAFT)

The Research Prospectus prepares you for your Final Project in this course: either the [Essay Option](essay.html) or the [Exhibit Option](exhibit.html). Note that you needn't commit to an option to complete this assignment. 

The prospectus is *open-book*,  meaning you are allowed to use the course website, the class notebook, your own notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, books, journal articles, games, and the internet to address the prompt.

*Please cite your source material.*

## Download and Complete the Prospectus Template

Please [download the prospectus template](mdia360v2Prospectus.docx) (DOCX format) and complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac.  

## Format

The prospectus template contains *---* prompts. Please respond to all of them. I will mark the prospectus holistically rather than giving each response a separate mark. 

Some prompts ask you to create media. Please attach your audio, image, or video files to your response in Brightspace. Do *not* use YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Google Drive, or any other non-Brightspace platform to submit files. 

If you play a game with someone else or observe them playing (outside of Twitch, YouTube, or a similar public streaming or publishing platform), then please first acquire their written or recorded permission and include it as part of your submission. 

## The Prompts 

1. Provide a working title for your Final Project. It will probably change by the time you submit the project. 
2. Use no more than 175 words to describe a game you might play for your Final Project. Explain why it's interesting and identify who thinks it's interesting (e.g., which fans, critics, or communities). 
3. Use no more than 175 words to describe a Game Studies topic you want to address in your Final Project. Explain why the topic matters and for whom it matters most.
4. Use no more than 175 words to describe a problem in Game Studies that will likely motivate your Final Project. What or who, for instance, has been overlooked? Misinterpreted? Privileged or marginalized? 
5. Use a sentence or two to share a specific goal you want your Final Project to achieve. What do you want to learn? What question do you hope to address? What do you want to change? 
6. Use no more than 175 words to identify a [Module 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2/#module-1-culture-four-sessions) concept and explain its potential relevance to your Final Project.  
7. Use no more than 175 words to identify a [Module 2 concept](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2/#module-2-play-and-metagaming-seven-sessions) and explain its potential relevance to your Final Project. 
8. Use no more than 175 words to identify two [Module 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2/#module-3-values-and-design-nine-sessions) concepts and explain their potential relevance to your Final Project. This response will be somewhat conjectural since we haven't completed Module 3. 
9. Identify three secondary sources referenced in the class notebook that will likely inform your research for the Final Project. For each source, use a sentence or two to explain its relevance to your work. 
10. Use no more than 175 words to outline your plan for completing the Final Project. What will you do first? Where will go next? What will you prioritize, and what will you save for later? Identify what's within and beyond the scope of your inquiry (that is, what you do and don't have the time and resources to address in this course).  

## Assessment 

Your mark for the Research Prospectus constitutes 20% of your final mark in this course. 

I will use the following criteria to assess your responses. 

The degree to which they: 

* Address each aspect of the prompt.
* Directly engage and even enhance the course material.
* Are supported by a convincing use of detail and examples.  
* Apply theories, findings, publications, and terminology from the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and research referenced in that notebook.
* Communicate synthetically and make connections across the course material. 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your responses. 

* 89.5-100 (exceeds all expectations of the worksheet): the responses are compelling; they address all the prompts and apply course terminology; they enhance the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 79.5-89 points (exceeds some or most expectations of the worksheet): the responses are compelling; they address all the prompts and apply course terminology; they correspond with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 69.5-79 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations of the worksheet): the responses address all the prompts and apply course terminology; they correspond with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 59.5-69 points (meets some expectations of the worksheet): the responses address some of the prompts and apply some course terminology; they correspond with some of the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 49.5-59 points (does not meet the expectations of the worksheet): the responses do not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompts
* 0-49 points: no responses or incomplete responses 

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references are included at the end of the worksheet (see "Citing Your Sources").

8 points will be deducted from the overall mark if the references at the end of the worksheet are not formatted according to an established citation style (see "Citing Your Sources").

5 points will be deducted for every source that’s used in a response but is not included in the references section at the end of the worksheet (see “Citing Your Sources”).

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each response to earn a high mark.* 

I also recommend writing your responses from the first-person perspective. That point of view makes it easier for you to explain your decisions and share what you learned from each exercise.

## AI Tools 

I do not recommend relying on generative AI or other AI tools to respond to this assignment. AI-generated responses tend to be generic, and they lack self-reflection, which is a key element of the work you're doing here. AI results can also be biased and incorrect. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. You should also pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content (including copyrighted materials, original work, and personal information) you upload, paste, or share with them. In short, relying on AI could create more work for you in the end, and it tends to hinder and even "deskill" the learning process. 

All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. (Language for this policy was drawn from language used at the University of Washington.)

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. This includes games, videos, podcasts, websites, magazines, streams, and AI tools (if you decide to use them) as well as academic publications such as monographs and journal articles. You are welcome to use your preferred citation style (MLA, Chicago, or APA, e.g.).  

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, or PDF file containing your answers and references along with any media files you were prompted to attach or embed. 

## When to Submit It

A response to the Research Prospectus is due by 1pm on Monday, March 16th, but there is a grace period. I will deduct five points for every business day I receive the Prospectus after 1pm on Tuesday, March 17th. I will close the submission portal for the Prospectus at 1pm on Monday, March 30th, and cannot accept any submissions after the portal is closed. I will not accept any submissions by email.

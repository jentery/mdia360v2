# Game Studies (DRAFT) 

Media Studies 360: "Games as both culture and material. Surveys approaches to play and games around the world, from board and tabletop games to video games, alternate reality games and even sports."

## Module 1: Culture 

We'll begin the course by contextualizing play and attending to the activities, norms, assumptions, and communities at work in games.  

## 1.1 Situating Play in Games 

How do we know we're playing? Who is free to play? How is play shaped by the game you're playing and where you play it? By socialization or cultural assumptions about what *counts* as work or leisure?   

**Examples**: [*Pokémon GO*](https://pokemongo.com/), [*Squid Game*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game), [*Wordle*](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and [*World of Warcraft*](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/) 

**Discussion**: treating romance as a game in [*Fog of Love*](https://floodgate.games/products/fog-of-love) 

**Concepts**: affordances, agôn, alea, alternate reality games, arcade games, bleed, board games, card games, chess, conventions, customs, fair play, game, gameshow, goldfarming, "got played," grinding, ilinx, immersion, labour, leisure, local game store, ludus, magic circle, mimicry, paidia, parameters, parlour games, play, the privilege of play, the right to play, the sanctity of play, sport, tabletop games, toys, unnecessary obstacle, video games, voluntary attempt, "well played," and work

## 1.2 Gamification: Motivation, Behaviour, and Learning 

What is gamification, what does it assume about people, and does it even work? Are games and gamification the same thing? How do companies instrumentalize game design to encourage productivity, track learning and norm behaviours? To motivate people to play and keep playing? 

**Examples**: [*Duolingo*](https://www.duolingo.com/), dating apps, and wearable tech and fitness monitors

**Discussion**: becoming a "Craft Master" in [*Stardew Valley*](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)

## 1.3 Ownership, Rights, and EDI in the Games Industry 

Who owns the games you play? How are games also commodities? What rights do game designers and developers have as workers? And what's the state of equity, diversity, and inclusion in the games industry, including the industry in Canada? 

**Examples**: [African Board Games Convention](https://theabcon.com/), [Black Game Devs](https://www.blackgamedevs.com/), [Femme Gaming](https://femmegaming.gg/), [Game Devs of Color Expo](https://www.gamedevsofcolor.org/), [Game Workers Coalition](https://gameworkerscoalition.org/en/), [Indigenous Game Devs](https://www.indigenousgamedevs.com/), [Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/), [Pixelles](https://pixelles.ca/), and [POC in Play](https://www.pocplay.org/)

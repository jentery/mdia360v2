# Game Studies (DRAFT) 

Media Studies 360: "Games as both culture and material. Surveys approaches to play and games around the world, from board and tabletop games to video games, alternate reality games and even sports."

## MODULE 1: CULTURE 

We'll begin the course by contextualizing play and attending to the activities, norms, assumptions, and communities at work in games.  

## 1.1: Situating Play in Games 

How do we know we're playing? Who is free to play? How is play shaped by the game you're playing and where you play it? By socialization? By cultural assumptions about what *counts* as work or leisure?   

**Examples**: [*Pokémon GO*](https://pokemongo.com/), [*Squid Game*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game), [*Wordle*](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and [*World of Warcraft*](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/) 

**Activity**: treating romance as a game in [*Fog of Love*](https://floodgate.games/products/fog-of-love) 

**Concepts**: abstracts or abstract games, affordances, agôn, alea, alternate reality games, arcade games, bleed, board games, card games, conventions, customs, fair play, the first game?, game, gameshow, goldfarming, "got played," grinding, histories of games, hobby, ilinx, immersion, labour, leisure, local game store, ludus, magic circle, mimicry, paidia, parameters, parlour games, play, the privilege of play, the right to play, the sanctity of play, sport, tabletop games, toys, unnecessary obstacle, video games, voluntary attempt, "well played," and work

## 1.2: Gamification: Motivation, Behaviour, and Learning 

What is gamification, what does it assume about people, and does it even work? Are games and gamification the same thing? How do companies instrumentalize game design to encourage productivity, track learning, and normalize behaviours? To motivate people to play and keep playing?

**Examples**: [*Duolingo*](https://www.duolingo.com/), dating apps, and wearable tech and fitness monitors

**Activity**: becoming a "Craft Master" in [*Stardew Valley*](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)

## 1.3: Ownership, Rights, and EDI in Game Industries 

Who owns the games you play? How do games become global commodities? What rights do game designers and developers have as workers? And what's the state of equity, diversity, and inclusion in game industries, including game industries in Canada?

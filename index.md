# Territory Acknowledgement 

We acknowledge and respect the L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n (Songhees and X&#695;seps&#601;m / Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n and W&#817;S&#193;NE&#262; Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

In [this video](https://youtu.be/RJHMmMwTl_Q?si=9x4rNjmbCZ_O6HhW), Yux&#8217;wey&#8217;lupton, Dr. Clarence "Butch" Dick of the Songhees Nation, welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n (Songhees and X&#695;seps&#601;m / Esquimalt) and W&#817;S&#193;NE&#262; Peoples in L&#601;k&#787;&#695;&#601;&#331;&#601;n and English. The updated acknowledgement was developed through UVic's continued dialogue and relationships with the local Nations, in recognition of their presence and governance structure in these territories. 

The video supports the UVic community to engage more meaningfully with the territorial acknowledgement. It is intended to inspire reflection, learning and accountability&#8212;while acknowledging that this is one step in a much broader journey of &#660;etaln&#601;w&#787;&#601;l&#787; / &#193;TOL,NEUEL / Respecting the rights of one another and being in right relationship with all things. It is one part of our shared, ongoing commitment to understanding the responsibilities we hold as guests in these territories and to act in ways that uphold our relationships with the original stewards of these lands.  

# Description

Echoing [UVic's academic calendar](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/view/654c0cc20d124d28da5f725c), this course is about "games as both culture and material. Surveys approaches to play and games around the world, from board and tabletop games to video games, alternate reality games and even sports. Emphasis on experiential learning in UVic Libraries and local communities."

The course counts toward UVic's new [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/programs/rJP4a8byi?bc=true&bcCurrent=Media%20Studies&bcItemType=programs) certificate, which requires only 10.5 units of coursework. 

# Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for playing and understanding games. This means you'll learn a lexicon for conversing with game critics, designers, and developers.  
2. Practice techniques for documenting play. This means you'll record gameplay, describe it, write about it, and reflect on it. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of games across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions games are made, played, and circulated. 
4. Respond directly to classroom activities and lectures about games. This means you'll complete fourteen exit tickets and two worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning.  
5. Produce a multimodal argument about a game or Game Studies topic of your choice. This means you'll use video, audio, and/or images plus text to craft a public-facing final project, supported by a research prospectus, by the end of term. 

Please note that this is not a Game History, History of Gaming, Game Preservation, or Game Design course. 

I will assume you've no experience in Games Studies, and I will focus on approaches to games as they apply to games media and criticism. I won't assume you've much, if any, experience playing video, tabletop, card, or board games or that you (care to) identify as a gamer. 

# About Me

My name is Jentery Sayers (he/him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. 

I spend 8.16% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I relocated to Victoria the summer I received my PhD, and I currently direct UVic's Media Studies program. I like to play TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and basketball in my spare time. I also do my best to maintain a [portfolio](https://jntry.work/) of my work. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. My office hours are Monday and Thursday, 11:45am-12:45pm, or by appointment, in CLE D331. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays.

# Materials

*Content warnings*: I'll include content warnings for games before I play or screen them in class.

*Class notebook*: I will create a class notebook for this course and update it throughout the term. It'll be available online, and I recommend checking it at least twice a week (after each class session). I will use it to share aspects of my lectures, document what we're doing in class, ask you questions, and point you to primary and secondary sources, including games and Game Studies publications. The URL for the notebook is available in Brightspace. Please do not share it with anyone who is not in this course.

*Recordings*: I do not plan to record our class sessions; however, you are welcome to record audio for private access, study, and note-taking.
 
*Brightspace*: I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate a class announcement each week to help you plan for what's next,
* Share clips of games and links to the class notebook,
* Point you to games, collections, journal articles, books, video essays, and other resources available online,
* Accept all of your assignments except the exit tickets (please don't submit anything to me by email), and
* Mark those assignments and provide feedback on them.

# Assignments

There are no exams, quizzes, or presentations in this course.

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term. 

* [**Exit tickets**](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2/exittickets.html): 10% of your final grade (fourteen of them, each due by the end of class on the day prompted)  
* **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Monday, January 26th at 1pm)
* **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Monday, February 23rd at 1pm)
* [**Research prospectus**](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2prospectus.html) 20% of your final grade (due by Monday, March 16th at 1pm) 
* **[Final project](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2finalproject.html)**: 30% of your final grade (due by Thursday, April 16th at 1pm)   

*Exit tickets*: At the end of twenty-one different class sessions, I will ask you to use a notecard (which I will provide) to respond to two prompts. These prompts will ask you to share what you're learning from class sessions, what you hope to learn, and what questions you have. You will submit your responses (on the notecard) to me by the end of class. You should submit a total of fourteen exit tickets (meaning you don't need to submit one at the end of every class), and I will track your submissions in Brightspace. See the schedule below for sessions *without* an exit ticket. 

*Worksheets*: The worksheets will ask you to apply what you're learning in class through a combination of media (audio, images, text, and video), and I will encourage you to use class time to take notes and draft your responses to them. I will circulate each worksheet well before it's due, and I'll review each prompt in class to ensure it's clear. The worksheets and their grading rubrics are posted online (see links above). You should download them, complete them in your word processor of choice (e.g., Word, Docs, Pages), and submit them via Brightspace. 

*Research prospectus*: The prospectus will prompt you to prepare a foundation for your final project. This way, you begin working on the project well before it's due. You will identify your topic and research question, share your critical approach to them, describe the structure of your project, explain your project's contribution to Game Studies, and support your inquiry with a brief, annotated bibliography. 

*Final project*: You will have three choices for your final project: 1) a video essay (10-16 minutes, including at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage), 2) a written essay (1500-2500 words plus at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage), or 3) a digital exhibit (1250-2250 words plus metadata and at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage). The exit tickets, worksheets, and research prospectus will scaffold your learning toward the final project, which I'll ask you to approach with a public audience in mind (e.g., viewers of a specific channel or readers of a particular games website or magazine). I will also encourage you to write from a first-person perspective. Note that each option involves the use of your own gameplay footage.

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit your worksheets, research prospectus, and final project. You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace, but you will need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer. I cannot accept assignments (including exit tickets) by email.

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on assignments according to their grading rubrics. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss the feedback. Again, I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much or we're juggling more than we should, then I'll cut material. I planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 6 hours* to MDIA 360 each week in addition to our weekly meetings on Monday and Thursday. Of course, 3 to 6 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your familiarity with the materials and work involved.

# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the term. It's subject to change. In fact, I'm 99.12% certain it will change. I will use a Brightspace announcement to notify you at least two weeks in advance of those changes, and I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload (e.g., add an assignment or reading). 

All meetings are scheduled to occur in person (face-to-face). I will assume you are attending each class meeting. If you are unable to attend, then please email me in advance and coordinate with a peer to get notes and the like from the session(s) you'll miss.

You are welcome to record audio of the following sessions for private access, study, and note-taking.

Activity: Conduct a fly-on-the-wall observation of a game and its settings using the Elito method. 

After class, please read "Accessibility, Trust, and Tutorialization" in the class notebook. 

## Th Mar. 5: Worldbuilding and Worldviews

How is a world more than the setting of a game? What do gameworlds make possible? What do they value? How and when do we encounter their limits and boundaries?

## M Mar. 16: Narrative, Pacing, and Progression 

When and why do choices matter in a game's narrative? How and to what effects is progression gated, and to what degree can the rhythm of activities and events be designed? How do player stories differ from game narratives, and how do game environments evoke, trigger, and stage storytelling? 

Activities: Let's read [_Under a Star Called Sun_](https://haraiva.itch.io/under-a-star-called-sun) and discuss memorable beats, arcs, and player stories. 

After class, please read "Narrative, Pacing, and Progression" in the class notebook. 

*The research prospectus is due today by 1pm.* 

## Th Mar. 19: Simulation and Management

How do simulations train players? Test systems? Entertain the absurd? Revel in the mundane? How do games establish high-fidelity connections between in-game (diegetic) experiences and everyday (non-diegetic) life?

Activities: You field calls to the [_Home Safety Hotline_](https://nightsignalentertainment.itch.io/home-safety-hotline) and notice something's distinctly wrong.

It's a way to gain meaningful hands-on experience that supports and honours the community and strengthens your academic experience. 

### Academic Concessions and Accommodations

If your academic courses are affected by illness, accident, or family affliction, you may wish to request an [academic concession](https://www.uvic.ca/students/academics/academic-concessions-accommodations/index.php). Are you a student with a learning disability, ADHD, mental health issue, or long-term recurring physical or sensory disability? Do you have chronic health issues? If you do, UVic provides academic accommodations to address barriers to your education.  

### Student Wellness 

Their [team of practitioners](https://www.uvic.ca/student-wellness/) offers a variety of services to support students' mental, physical, and spiritual health. You can make a same-day or pre-booked appointment with a counsellor, nurse, physician, or spiritual care provider.

### Ombudsperson

The [ombuds office](https://uvicombudsperson.ca/) is an independent, impartial, and confidential resource for undergraduate and graduate students and other members of the University of Victoria community. The ombudsperson helps resolve student problems or disputes fairly. 

### Student Groups

# Policies 

Here are the policies for this course alongside several UVic policies. Please let me know if anything is unclear, ignorant, or mistaken. I'll correct it. 

### Media Studies Certificate 

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies certificate](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/programs/rJP4a8byi?bc=true&bcCurrent=Media%20Studies&bcItemType=programs). 

### Office Hours and Contacting Me

The best way to communicate with me is by email ([jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca)) or during office hours, which are Monday and Thursday, 11:45am-12:45pm in CLE D331. I can also make an appointment to meet with you in person or via Zoom. 

I respond to email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 

### Assessment and Feedback

You must submit the final project and at least one worksheet to pass this course. Failure to complete these three assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use UVic's [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to produce rubrics to assess your work. I will not post marks publicly or outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism or AI detection software.

All assignments except for the exit tickets should be submitted via Brightspace. I cannot accept worksheets, the research prospectus, or the final project via email. Each exit ticket is due by the end of class (11:20am) on the day it's prompted. 

I will use Brightspace to provide feedback on your work. If you ever want additional feedback, then feel free to ask me. I can provide it in person, via Zoom, or by email. 

Throughout the term, I'll request feedback from you on how the course is going. I'll also ask you to complete learning experience surveys at the end of the term. 

### Late Submissions and Extensions

I've a 24-hour grace period (no questions asked, no email required, and no penalties) for every assignment (except the exit tickets) in this course. A late penalty of five points per business day will apply after 24 hours. Weekends and holidays do not count as business days. 

I will not accept worksheets or the research prospectus more than two weeks after they are due and cannot accept the final project after Monday, April 20th at 1pm.

Please email me if you need an extension for any assignment, and we can discuss possibilities on a case-by-case basis.    

### Attendance and Participation

There is no participation or attendance mark in this course; however, every class session will rely heavily on discussion and interaction. I will assume you are attending each class meeting. If you are unable to attend a particular meeting, then please email me in advance and coordinate with a peer to get notes and the like from the session(s) you'll miss. 

*You do not need to provide me with documentation for an absence.*

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)

I aim to create an inclusive learning environment that attends to difference and honours each of you, including your experiences at the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, religion, power, and class. I want to be a resource for you, and I continue to learn about EDI. If something is said in class (by anyone, including me) that makes you feel uncomfortable, then don't hesitate to talk with me. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your university records, then let me know, and I'll correct the documents provided to me. If your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside of class, then keep me posted, and we'll make adjustments. I also welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the course, and I will make available mechanisms for anonymous feedback since you may prefer them.

### Information for All Students 

This [page](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/content/64b07a85168098001c8e8a49) contains a list of important UVic policies.  

### Creating a Respectful, Inclusive, and Productive Learning Environment

UVic is committed to promoting critical academic discourse while providing a respectful and productive learning environment across all modalities of learning and teaching. All members of the university community have the right to experience, and the responsibility to help create, such an environment. In any course, the instructor has the primary responsibility for creating a respectful, inclusive and productive learning environment in a manner consistent with other university policies and regulations. Instructors or students who have unresolved questions or concerns about a particular learning environment should bring them to the Chair or Director of the unit concerned (or Dean, in the case of undepartmentalized faculties).

### Accessibility 

UVic commits to addressing and removing barriers that hinder full and equal participation of people with disabilities. UVic's [Accessibility Plan](https://www.uvic.ca/info/accessibility/index.php) includes guiding principles and existing resources. It summarizes consultations, barriers, and priorities for the next three years to address those barriers.

### Equity Action Plan 

[The Equity Action Plan](https://www.uvic.ca/equity-action-plan/index.php)'s goals provide UVic with strategic direction to advance equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to create the conditions in which everyone feels a sense of belonging: as connected and respected parts of the university community.

### Sexualized Violence Prevention and Response 

UVic's [Sexualized Violence Resource Office](https://www.uvic.ca/sexualizedviolence/) in Equity and Human Rights (EQHR) offers information on how to start the conversation about consent, where to get support on and off campus, and the options available under UVic’s Sexualized Violence Prevention and Response Policy.

### Accommodation of Religious Observance 

UVic recognizes its obligation to make reasonable accommodation for students whose observance of holy days might conflict with the academic requirements of a course or program. Students are permitted to absent themselves from classes, seminars, or workshops for the purposes of religious or spiritual observance. In the case of compulsory classes or course events, students will normally be required to provide reasonable notice to their instructors of their intended absence from the class or event for reasons of religious or spiritual observance. In consultation with the student, the instructor will determine an appropriate means of accommodation. The instructor may choose to reschedule classes or provide individual assistance. Where a student's participation in a class event is subject to grading, every reasonable effort will be made to allow the student to make up for the missed class through alternative assignments or in subsequent classes. Students who require a rescheduled examination must give reasonable notice to their instructors. If a final exam cannot be rescheduled within the regular exam period, students may request an academic concession.

### Student Conduct

UVic is committed to promoting a safe, respectful and supportive learning, living, and working environment. As part of the university community, each student is responsible for their personal conduct as it affects the university community, university activities, and the university's property. [The Office of Student Life](https://www.uvic.ca/services/studentlife/student-conduct/index.php) works directly with the university community to review and help resolve non-academic student conduct concerns. They administer the university's Resolution of Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy and serve as a supportive resource to the university community.

### Non-Academic Student Conduct 

UVic's [Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy](https://www.uvic.ca/universitysecretary/assets/docs/policies/AC1300.pdf) (AC1300) clarifies what non-academic student misconduct is; details how the university responds to non-academic misconduct allegations; outlines the review and investigation processes; describes possible outcomes and ensures that when misconduct is found to have occurred, any sanctions that are applied are fair and consistent; and, explains how to appeal a decision that has been made under the policy.

### Academic Integrity  

[Academic integrity](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/Sk_0xsM_V) requires commitment to the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. It is expected that students, faculty members, and staff at the University of Victoria, as members of an intellectual community, will adhere to these ethical values in all activities related to learning, teaching, research, and service. Any action that contravenes this standard, including misrepresentation, falsification, or deception, undermines the intention and worth of scholarly work and violates the fundamental academic rights of members of our community. This policy is designed to ensure that the university's standards are upheld in a fair and transparent fashion.

Students are responsible for the entire content and form of their work. Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit students from developing their academic skills through the exchange of ideas and the utilization of resources available at the university to support learning (e.g., The Centre for Academic Communication). Students who are in doubt as to what constitutes a violation of academic integrity in a particular instance should consult their course instructor.

### Copyright 

All course materials, including my slides, handouts, and lectures, are made available for educational purposes and the exclusive use of students in this course. The material is protected under copyright law even if it is not marked as such, and the syllabus is licensed [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). Any further use or distribution of materials to others requires written permission, except under fair dealing or another exception in the Copyright Act. Violations may result in disciplinary action under the Resolution of Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy (AC1300). 

### Generative AI 

UVic encourages innovative teaching practices and supports instructors who may like to adopt new pedagogical approaches and learning technologies. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is a form of machine learning with the capabilities to produce text, images, video, music, code, etc. UVic does not have a general ban on the use of GenAI tools, including ChatGPT. Instead, UVic embraces the appropriate and ethical use of GenAI in learning and teaching. The university recognizes potential concerns associated with the use of GenAI, including potential biases in the algorithms and the possibility that GenAI might be used in ways that violate academic integrity principles and intellectual property rights. Faculty and instructors are best positioned to make decisions about the use of GenAI in their courses. UVic offers [guidelines](https://teachanywhere.uvic.ca/academic-integrity/ai-evaluation/) to support faculty, instructors, and students in the responsible, effective, and ethical use of artificial intelligence tools. These guidelines also support principles of academic integrity and help to prepare students for a future where the use of GenAI continues to evolve.

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any supports to succeed. I'll do my best to help. If, for instance, you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education.

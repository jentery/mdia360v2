Media Studies 360 at UVic: "Games as both culture and material. Surveys approaches to play and games around the world, from board and tabletop games to video games, alternate reality games and even sports."

## MODULE 1: CULTURE (FOUR SESSIONS)

We'll begin the course by contextualizing play and attending to the activities, communities, norms, and assumptions at work in games, including video and tabletop games as well as related phenomena such as gamification, gambling, and sports, including esports.   

As the course unfolds, I recommend following [*Critical Distance*](https://www.critical-distance.com/) for weekly roundups of what's happening in Game Studies and writing about games. 

## 1.1: Situating Play in Games 

How do we know when we're playing? Who is free to play? How is play shaped by socialization? By the boundaries of games and where we play them? By norms and cultural assumptions about what *counts* as work or leisure?   

**Examples**: [*Darkon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_iDuVGXbs0), [*Pokémon Go*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01490400.2018.1426064), [*Squid Game*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3990316), [*Wordle*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02110), and [*World of Warcraft*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3cmCKjPLR8) 

**Discussion**: "Are you playing?" The boundaries between [real-life relationships and roleplay](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/11/20/playing-fog-of-love-made-me-and-my-husband-break-up/) begin to blur in *Fog of Love*, a cooperative-competitive romcom relationship sim. 

**Activity**: What happens when 39 people play [*Ultimate Werewolf*](https://beziergames.com/products/ultimate-werewolf)?

## 1.2: Keep Playing: From Motivation to Exploitation

Gaming, gamification, and gambling are everywhere today. How do companies of all kinds use game design to encourage learning, competition, and productivity? To track activities and influence behaviours? To keep people playing? Is it all just a gimmick? When does it work, and when does it become exploitative? 

**Examples**: [daily fantasy sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_fantasy_sports), [*Duolingo* and learning apps](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09588221.2021.1933540#abstract), ["Hang the DJ" and dating apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5N_Tq1EtRQ), [*Minecraft* and game-based learning](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ade2b1/meta), and [wearable tech and fitness monitors](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137017)

## 1.3: Ownership, Rights, and EDI in Game Industries

## 1.4: Hate, Toxicity, and Harassment in Gaming Communities 

What games, gaming spaces, and gaming content do you avoid, and why? Are you active in any gaming communities? If so, how do they organize to protect their members?

Do they have a history of harassing streamers, developers, or journalists? 

**Examples**: Gamergate, Nexus Mods, and reactionary gaming

# Final Project: Essay Option (DRAFT)

The Essay Option for the Final Project in MDIA360 covers all course material since January 8th ("Situating Play"). Your response is due via Brightspace by Thursday, April 16th, at 1pm. The [Exhibit](exhibit.html) is your other option for the Final Project. It has the same due date.

This assignment is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use the course website, the class notebook, your own notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, books, journal articles, games, and the internet to address the prompt.

I recommend reviewing your WS1, WS2, and research prospectus before you begin this assignment. How might you integrate some of that material with your final project? Build on existing research. Avoid reinventing the wheel. Also . . .

*Please cite your source material.*

## Scenario 

Imagine that a publication venue invited you to submit an essay on a game and topic of your choice. The venue is open to a *video essay* (10-16 minutes) or *written essay* (1500-2500 words); either way, they want you to also include at least five minutes of *your own gameplay footage*. That way, the venue's audience has unique access to the game you select. 

Before you proceed, you should identify the publication venue by title. It should actually exist, and it should be active. Types of pertinent publication venues include academic journals, commercial or independent websites and magazines, and channels on video-sharing platforms. 

## Format 

The venue says your video essay (10-16 minutes) or written essay (1500-2500 words) should:

1. Have a descriptive yet engaging title. 
2. Follow a recognizable theme from start to finish. 
3. Have a style that corresponds with their style, mission, and readership/viewership. 
4. Demonstrate an awareness of their readership/viewership's interests and expectations. 
5. Engage a current topic in games. 
6. Explain or demonstrate why the topic matters and for whom it matters most.
7. Include at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage,
8. Be intentionally scoped. (The goals should be clear, and the topic should be addressable in 10-16 minutes / 1500-2500 words.)  
9. Converse with existing work related to your game and theme.
10. Acknowledge designers, developers, studios, and fellow critics by name. 
11. Include credits or references.

Some questions to consider: What are the venue's conventions? Do you want to be a "main character" in your essay? Do you want people to hear your voice (on or off camera), or do you want them to read your writing? Will you break the fourth wall? Are you bringing your audience on an emotional journey (pathos) through your essay? Are you using logic (logos) to make an [argument](https://depts.washington.edu/owrcweb/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Claims-Claims-Claims.pdf)? Who is your crew of fellow critics (ethos), and how are you conversing with them, citing them, and building on their work? How are you pacing (kairos) your essay for your audience to follow along? 

## Assessment 

Your mark for the Final Project constitutes 30% of your final mark in this course. 

Note that, as part of your response to the above scenario, you're expected to *cite, integrate, and apply some course material from each of MDIA360's three modules* (including secondary sources referenced in the class notebook).

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your essay. 

* 89.5-100 (exceeds all expectations): the essay is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it enhances the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 79.5-89 points (exceeds some or most expectations): the essay is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 69.5-79 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations): the essay addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 59.5-69 points (meets some expectations): the essay addresses some of the prompt and applies some course terminology; it corresponds with some of the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 49.5-59 points (does not meet the expectations): the essay does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompt
* 0-49 points: no essay or an incomplete essay

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count or every ten seconds over the time limit.  

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if you do not include references or credits. 

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if you do not include at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage.

*I will assess your essay as if it represents the culmination of what you learned in this course.* I recommend starting it as soon as possible. I also recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your essay. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. You should use an established citation style (such as Chicago, MLA, or APA) if you're producing a references section. You're also welcome to play with a citation style if you're producing credits for a video essay; however, your credits should include enough information for your audience to locate your source materials.   

When in doubt, cite it. 

## What to Submit 

Please submit: 

1. A DOCX, ODT, PAGES, PDF, MOV, or MP4 file containing your essay, 
2. The title of the intended publication venue, and
3. Any other files you wish to attach. 
 
Transcripts of video essays are welcome but not expected for this assignment. 

## When to Submit It

Your response to this assignment is due by 1pm on Thursday, April 16th. I will deduct ten points for every business day that I receive it after 1pm on Friday, April 17th. I will close the submission portal on Wednesday, April 22nd at 1pm and cannot accept any submissions after it's closed. I do not accept submissions by email.

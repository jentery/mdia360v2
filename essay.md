# Final Project: Essay Option (DRAFT)

The Essay Option for the Final Project in MDIA360 covers course material since January 8th ("Situating Play"). Your response is due via Brightspace by Thursday, April 16th, at 1pm.

This assignment is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use the course website, the class notebook, your own notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, books, journal articles, games, and the internet to address the prompt.

I recommend preparing for your essay by reviewing WS1, WS2, and the Research Prospectus. How might you integrate some of that material with your essay? Build on existing research. Avoid reinventing the wheel.

*Please cite your source material.*

Before you proceed with this assignment, note that an [Exhibit](exhibit.html) is your other option for the Final Project. 

## Format 

You have two options for the essay: 

1. A video essay of 10-16 minutes, including at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage, or 
2. A written essay of 1500-2500 words, including at least five minutes of your own gameplay footage.

You should *not* submit a text-only, audio-only, or text+image essay.  

The essay should be accompanied by: 

1. Credits or a references section, and 
2. A 150-word abstract that describes your project and identifies its venue and audience. (Details below.)

Please include your 150-word abstract either at the beginning of your essay or in the comments section of the Brightspace submission form for this assignment. 

## Venue and Audience

You should identify an appropriate venue for your essay. Types of venues include: 

* Academic journals (print or online),
* Commercial or independent games media publications (print or online), and
* Channels on video-sharing platforms (your own channel or someone else's).

Please include the title of the venue in your 150-word abstract as well as a URL for it.  

You should also identify the intended audience for your essay. Audiences include: 

* Game Studies scholars with interests in X (where "X" is an area in the field),
* Fans of X game (where "X" is the title of a game), and
* Readers of X venue (where "X venue" is the title of the venue you identified above).

Please mention your intended audience in your 150-word abstract (e.g., "This essay is intended for X"). 

Your audience needn't be academic, but your essay should "fit" stylistically with the venue and audience you selected. Consider your word choice, voice, delivery, writing conventions, and use of evidence or examples. Aim to converse with your audience. Avoid talking down to them. 

## Language, Media, and Perspective 

You are welcome to use first-, second-, and/or third-person language in your essay. (I strongly encourage some use of the first-person perspective.) You are also welcome to include voice-over, a face camera, documentation of you playing a game, or the like. At least five minutes of your own gameplay footage is required.

Some questions to consider: Do you want to be a "main character" in the argument you're making? Do you want people to hear your voice (on or off camera), or do you want them to read your writing? Will you break the fourth wall? Are you bringing your intended audience on an emotional journey (pathos) through your essay? Are you leaning into the logic (logos) of a game's design? Who is your crew of fellow critics (ethos), and how are you conversing with them and building on their work? How are you pacing (kairos) your essay for your intended audience to follow along? 

## The Prompt

Please compose a video essay or written essay that: 

* Addresses a specific game or topic in Game Studies. 
* Follows a recognizable theme from start to finish. 
* Is intentionally scoped with clear goals and a clear sense of direction. (Avoid talking about "all the things." When in doubt, cut it out.) 
* Fits stylistically with its intended venue (see above). 
* Exhibits an awareness of its audience, their knowledge, and their expectations. 
* Engages current or pressing issues in Game Studies, including issues addressed by multiple entries in the MDIA360 class notebook. 
* Explains or demonstrates why these issues matter, for whom they matter most, and how you're approaching them. 
* Includes an [interesting and arguable claim](https://depts.washington.edu/owrcweb/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Claims-Claims-Claims.pdf) with which someone could disagree.
* Uses your own gameplay footage to support or enact that claim. Your gameplay footage should provide your audience with unique access to a game you've played (where "unique" means "not available elsewhere" and/or "specific to my playstyle").
* Integrates at least five secondary sources with your essay's theme and research. You should quote, paraphrase, or otherwise integrate material from these five sources. Secondary sources may include academic publications, games media and criticism, and video essays and recorded talks. I recommend mixing it up, but at least two of the secondary sources should be academic publications (from journals or university presses). 
* Converses with existing work related to your theme. Acknowledge designers, developers, studios, and fellow critics by name in your essay. 
* Contains credits or a references section. 

Your essay should be accompanied by a 150-word abstract that describes the essay and identifies its venue and audience (see above).  

## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your essay. 

* 89.5-100 (exceeds all expectations): the essay is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it enhances the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 79.5-89 points (exceeds some or most expectations): the essay is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 69.5-79 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations): the essay addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 59.5-69 points (meets some expectations): the essay addresses some of the prompt and applies some course terminology; it corresponds with some of the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 49.5-59 points (does not meet the expectations): the essay does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompt
* 0-49 points: no essay or an incomplete essay

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count or every ten seconds over the time limit.  

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references or credits are included. 

Your mark for the essay will constitute 30% of your mark in this course. 

*I will assess your essay as if it represents the culmination of what you learned in this course.* I recommend starting it as soon as possible. I also recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your essay. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. You should use an established citation style (such as Chicago, MLA, or APA) if you're producing a references section. You're also welcome to play with a citation style if you're producing credits for a video essay; however, your credits should include enough information for your audience to locate your source materials.   

When in doubt, cite it. 

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, PDF, MOV, or MP4 file containing your essay along with any other files you wish to attach. Transcripts for video essays are welcome but not expected for this assignment. 

## When to Submit It

Your essay is due by 1pm on Thursday, April 16th. I will deduct ten points for every business day that I receive your essay after 1pm on Friday, April 17th. I will close the submission portal on Wednesday, April 22nd at 1pm and cannot accept any submissions after it's closed. I do not accept submissions by email.

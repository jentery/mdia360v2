# Exit Tickets 

Near the end of twenty-one different class sessions, I will ask you to use a notecard (which I will provide) to respond in writing to two prompts. These prompts will ask you to share what you're learning from the course material, what you hope to learn, and what questions you have. You should submit your responses on the notecard to me as you exit the classroom. We'll call these notecards "exit tickets." 

## Number of Tickets to Submit

You should submit a total of *fourteen exit tickets* (across fourteen different class sessions) in response to the twenty-one I prompt this term. I cannot accept more than fourteen exit tickets per student. 

## Format 

As part of your exit ticket, please include the following information on the notecard I provide: 
 
1. Your first name and surname 
2. "MDIA360" 
3. One written response on each side of the card (there will be two prompts per ticket)
    
## Assessment 

Each submitted notecard is worth 10 points, and the ["Exit Ticket" assignment](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v2/index.html#assignments) (14 exit cards totalling 140 points) constitutes 10% of your final grade. 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess each of your exit tickets. 

* 9.0, 9.5, or 10 points: you addressed both questions; your responses referred explicitly to aspects of the course material (such as the notebook, lectures, and class discussions) and attended constructively to critical issues in Game Studies that we've not (yet) addressed or discussed
* 8.0 or 8.5 points: you addressed both questions; your responses referred explicitly to aspects of the course material (such as the notebook, lectures, and class discussions)
* 7.5 points: you addressed both questions; your responses referred implicitly or vaguely to aspects of the course material
* 7.0 points: you addressed both questions 
* 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0 points: you addressed one question; your response referred explicitly to aspects of the course material (such as the notebook, lectures, and class discussions) and attended constructively to critical issues pertinent to Media Studies that we've not (yet) addressed or discussed
* 4.5 or 5.0 points: you responded to one question; your response referred explicitly to aspects of the course material (such as the notebook, lectures, and class discussions)
* 4.0 points: you responded to one question; your response referred implicitly or vaguely to aspects of the course material
* 3.0 or 3.5 points: you responded to both prompts but didn't address the questions
* 2.0 or 2.5 points: you responded to only one prompt and didn't address the question
* 1.0 point: you submitted a notecard with your name and "MDIA360" but no responses on it

## What to Submit and When to Submit It

Please submit a notecard containing two responses (one per side of the card), your first name and surname, and "MDIA360" before the end of class on the day prompted. 

I cannot accept exit tickets via email or Brightspace. Thank you for understanding. 

## Tracking Your Submissions and Marks 

I will use the "Exit Tickets" assignment in Brightspace to track your fourteen submissions and share your marks for each ticket with you. Feedback on exit tickets will be available upon request. Please don't hesitate to ask for it.

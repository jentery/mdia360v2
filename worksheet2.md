# Worksheet 2

Worksheet 2 covers course material from January 22nd ("Satisfaction, Socializing, and the Immersion Problem") through February 12th ("Content Creation and Backseat Gaming"). Your response is due via Brightspace by Monday, February 23rd at 1pm. 

The worksheet is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use the course website, the class notebook, the gameplay footage collection, your own games, your own notes and books, audio recordings of class sessions, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

*Please cite your source material.*

## Download the Worksheet 

Please [download the worksheet](mdia360v2Worksheet2.docx) (DOCX format) and complete it in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Pages for Mac.  

## Format

This open-book worksheet contains *three* "choose-your-own-adventure" prompts. Please respond to all three of them. I will mark the worksheet holistically rather than giving each response a separate mark. 

Some prompts ask you to create media. Please attach your audio, image, or video files to your response in Brightspace. Do *not* use YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Google Drive, or any other non-Brightspace platform to submit files. 

If you play a game with someone else or observe them playing (outside of Twitch, YouTube, or a similar public streaming or publishing platform), then please first acquire their written or recorded permission and include it as part of your submission. 

## The Three Prompts

**Prompt 1 (required)**. Select a game of your choice, play it for about an hour, and take notes as you do. Then use no more than 500 words, including terminology from the class notebook, to describe and critically assess the play experience in terms of (select *one* of the following):

1. Immersion.
2. Agency. 
3. Affect. 

I encourage you to include documentation (video, audio, images, or notes) of the play session. 

**Prompt 2 (required)**. Select a game of your choice, play it for about an hour, and take notes as you do. Then use no more than 500 words, including terminology from the class notebook, to describe and critically assess your (select *one* of the following): 

1. Playstyle.
2. Roleplay. 
3. Relation to "playing it wrong" and/or "playing it right."

I encourage you to include documentation (video, audio, images, or notes) of the play session. 

**Prompt 3 (required)**. Select a game of your choice and then include documentation of you (select *one* of the following): 

1. Cheating at it. 
2. Attempting to optimize the results.  
3. Following house rules. 
4. Making your own fun. 
5. Backseat gaming. 

Then use no more than 500 words, including terminology from the class notebook, to describe and critically assess the play experience and your documentation of it. 

## Assessment 

Your mark for Worksheet 2 constitutes 20% of your final mark in this course. 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your responses. 

* 89.5-100 (exceeds all expectations of the worksheet): the responses are compelling; they address all the prompts and apply course terminology; they enhance the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 79.5-89 points (exceeds some or most expectations of the worksheet): the responses are compelling; they address all the prompts and apply course terminology; they correspond with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 69.5-79 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations of the worksheet): the responses address all the prompts and apply course terminology; they correspond with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 59.5-69 points (meets some expectations of the worksheet): the responses address some of the prompts and apply some course terminology; they correspond with some of the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 49.5-59 points (does not meet the expectations of the worksheet): the responses do not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompts
* 0-49 points: no responses or incomplete responses 

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references are included at the end of the worksheet (see "Citing Your Sources").

8 points will be deducted from the overall mark if the references at the end of the worksheet are not formatted according to an established citation style (see "Citing Your Sources").

5 points will be deducted for every source that’s used in a response but is not included in the references section at the end of the worksheet (see “Citing Your Sources”).

5 points will be deducted for every fabricated source used in the worksheet (see “Citing Your Sources”).

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each response to earn a high mark.* 

I recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your responses. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

I also recommend writing your responses from the first-person perspective. That point of view makes it easier for you to explain your decisions and share what you learned from each exercise.

## AI Tools 

I do not recommend relying on generative AI or other AI tools to respond to this assignment. AI-generated responses tend to be generic, and they lack self-reflection, which is a key element of every prompt in this worksheet. AI results can also be biased and incorrect. It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you use from AI is accurate. You should also pay attention to the privacy of your data. Many AI tools will incorporate and use any content (including copyrighted materials, original work, and personal information) you upload, paste, or share with them. In short, relying on AI could create more work for you in the end, and it tends to hinder and even "deskill" the learning process. 

All sources, including AI tools, must be properly cited. (Language for this policy was drawn from language used at the University of Washington.)

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. This includes games, videos, podcasts, websites, magazines, streams, and AI tools (if you decide to use them) as well as academic publications such as monographs and journal articles. You are welcome to use your preferred citation style (MLA, Chicago, or APA, e.g.).  

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, or PDF file containing your answers and references along with any media files you were prompted to attach or embed. 

## When to Submit It

A response to Worksheet 2 is due by 1pm on Monday, February 23rd, but there is a 24-hour grace period. I will deduct five points for every business day I receive Worksheet 2 after 1pm on Tuesday, February 24th. I will close the submission portal for Worksheet 2 at 1pm on Monday, March 9th, and cannot accept any submissions after the portal is closed. I will not accept any submissions by email.

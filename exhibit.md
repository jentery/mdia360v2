# Final Project: Exhibit Option

The Exhibit Option for the Final Project in MDIA360 covers course material since January 8th ("Situating Play"). Your response is due via Brightspace by Thursday, April 16th, at 1pm.

This assignment is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use the course website, the class notebook, your own notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, books, journal articles, games, and the internet to address the prompt.

I recommend preparing for your exhibit by reviewing WS1, WS2, and the Research Prospectus. How might you integrate some of that material with your exhibit? Build on your existing research. Avoid reinventing the wheel.

*Please cite your source material.*

Before you proceed with this assignment, note that an [Essay](essay.html) is your other option for the Final Project. 

## Format 

Your exhibit should include: 

1. 5-8 video files containing gameplay footage, each at least a minute long but no longer than five minutes. 
2. A [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15k2oHLyZU_kya3z9-KTsCqoR5iTfDKH-gYppdsZD-pk/edit?usp=sharing) containing metadata for each file. 
3. 1250-2250 words describing the footage and the game(s) documented, explaining their significance, and communicating why they should be included in UVic Media Studies' [Gameplay Footage Collection](https://echo360.ca/collections/438697b1-2c76-4729-8dc6-42d7409d8cb8) for use by researchers (including students) in the future. 
4. A references section, and 
5. A 150-word abstract that describes your project and its contributions to the [Gameplay Footage Collection](https://echo360.ca/collections/438697b1-2c76-4729-8dc6-42d7409d8cb8).

Please include your 150-word abstract either at the beginning of your exhibit or in the comments section of the Brightspace submission form for this assignment. 

## Audience

Current and future students, faculty, and staff in UVic's [Media Studies program](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/index.php) are your primary audience. Your exhibit should make a compelling case why your footage should be included in the [Gameplay Footage Collection](https://echo360.ca/collections/438697b1-2c76-4729-8dc6-42d7409d8cb8).

## Metadata 

Please copy or download this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15k2oHLyZU_kya3z9-KTsCqoR5iTfDKH-gYppdsZD-pk/edit?usp=sharing) and complete one row for every file in your exhibit (at least five rows and no more than eight).

Enter data in every column. Note that most columns contain dropdown menus ("controlled vocabularies") to facilitate the data entry process. 

Please consult this [documentation](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/metadata.html) if you have questions about the metadata fields or their vocabularies. I wrote it with members of my lab (the Praxis Studio). Email me if you still have questions after reviewing the documentation. 

## The Prompt

Your 5-8 video files should: 

* Document gameplay of an analog or digital game. The footage may contain voice-over, a face camera, actual play, and/or screen recording. You do *not* need to include yourself in the footage, and there may be many reasons why you shouldn't. When producing footage of video or computer games, please try to avoid video recordings of your screen and instead use screen recording software (unless you've a convincing reason to include participants and/or the context of play). 
* Document gameplay that was recorded purposefully. That is, there should be a reason why you recorded a particular moment in the game, and that reason should be relatively clear to your audience as they watch and listen. 
* Be accompanied by [metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15k2oHLyZU_kya3z9-KTsCqoR5iTfDKH-gYppdsZD-pk/edit?usp=sharing).
* Be accompanied by written or recorded permissions if you play a game with someone else or otherwise involve them in the footage. 

Your 1250-2250 words should: 

* Describe the game(s) you played. Consider mentioning the title of the game, its release year, the developer(s), the publisher(s), the genre(s), the developer's location(s), and the publisher class (e.g., indie, AAA). 
* Describe the footage you included and your reasons for recording these specific moments in the game.
* Describe the cultural, political, or social significance of the game and the footage you included. As you do, please draw upon issues addressed by multiple entries in the MDIA 360 class notebook. 
* Describe the technical, aesthetic, or historical significance of the game and the footage you included. As you do, please draw upon issues addressed by multiple entries in the MDIA 360 class notebook. 
* Explain why your 5-8 files should be included in UVic Media Studies' [Gameplay Footage Collection](https://echo360.ca/collections/438697b1-2c76-4729-8dc6-42d7409d8cb8) for use by researchers (including students) in the future. As you do, please consider issues of (planned) obsolescence. 
* Use a story or narrative to thread together the above descriptions and explanations. Feel free to use first-, second-, and/or third-person language to convey your story or narrative, which may be based on personal experience.
* Integrate your 5-8 files with that story or narrative by embedding or citing them and referring directly to them. Make the files part of your story. 
* Demonstrate an awareness of your audience, their knowledge, and their expectations. 
* Integrate at least three secondary sources with your exhibit's story or narrative. You should quote, paraphrase, or otherwise integrate material from these three sources. Secondary sources may include academic publications, games media and criticism, and video essays and recorded talks. 
* Converse with existing work related to your exhibit and footage. Acknowledge designers, developers, studios, and fellow critics by name in your exhibit. 

Your exhibit should be accompanied by a references sections and a 150-word abstract that describes your project and its contributions to the [Gameplay Footage Collection](https://echo360.ca/collections/438697b1-2c76-4729-8dc6-42d7409d8cb8).

## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your exhibit. 

* 89.5-100 (exceeds all expectations): the exhibit is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it enhances the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 79.5-89 points (exceeds some or most expectations): the exhibit is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 69.5-79 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations): the exhibit addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 59.5-69 points (meets some expectations): the exhibt addresses some of the prompt and applies some course terminology; it corresponds with some of the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 49.5-59 points (does not meet the expectations): the exhibt does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompt
* 0-49 points: no exhibit or an incomplete exhibit

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count.  

12 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references are included. 

Your mark for the exhibit will constitute 30% of your mark in this course. 

*I will assess your exhibit as if it represents the culmination of what you learned in this course.* I recommend starting it as soon as possible. I also recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your exhibit. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. You should use an established citation style (such as Chicago, MLA, or APA) for your citations and references section. 

When in doubt, cite it. 

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, or PDF file containing your exhibit alongside 5-8 MOV or MP4 files containing your gameplay footage and an XLSX or OSV file containing your spreadsheet and metadata. 

## When to Submit It

Your exhibit is due by 1pm on Thursday, April 16th. I will deduct ten points for every business day that I receive your exhibit after 1pm on Friday, April 17th. I will close the submission portal on Wednesday, April 22nd at 1pm and cannot accept any submissions after it's closed. I do not accept submissions by email.
